# CSV VIEWER

The following clean code exercise is processed in this repository: https://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/agility-katas/viewing-csv-files-i/

The relevant clean code principles are:

* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
* IOSP (Integration Operation Segregation Principle)

In addition, unit tests are created for the operational classes and integration tests for the integrative classes.

A clean error handling is out of scope.
