# CSV VIEWER

[Exercise](https://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/agility-katas/viewing-csv-files-i/) from the clean code training with [Stefan Lieser](https://lieser-online.de/)

The relevant clean code principles are:

* SRP (Single Responsibility Pattern)
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
* IOSP (Integration Operation Segregation Principle)

In addition, unit tests are created for the operational classes and integration tests for the integrative classes.

A clean error handling is out of scope.
